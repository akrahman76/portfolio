            This research focuses on Bengali video captioning. It implements sequence-to-sequence models (LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU) combined with CNN features (VGG-19, Inceptionv3, ResNet50v2) and introduces an attention mechanism for the first time in Bengali video captioning. A novel Bengali dataset is created from the MSVD dataset, and the attention-based model outperforms existing models, setting a new benchmark.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-1">
            It's a 2D OpenGL simulation of the Shakrain festival, where users can control a kite using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right). Pressing 'n' triggers a day-to-night transition, and during the night, sky lanterns light up the scene, adding to the festive atmosphere. The project provides an interactive and visually engaging experience of the traditional celebration.
