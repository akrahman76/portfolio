    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">I developed an on-device fall detection system that analyzes images captured from an IoT camera. The system uses BlazePose to extract body keypoints and BLIP (Bootstrapped Language Image Pretraining) to generate image captions. By combining pose estimation and image understanding, it can accurately detect potential fall events in real time without relying on cloud processing.</p>

      Built with Astro, styled with Tailwind — powered by coffee and stubbornness.<br>
      I crafted a lightweight, responsive portfolio to showcase my projects, skills, and a little bit of personality.  
      Fully responsive because, let's face it, showing off shouldn't be limited to desktops!
